"This is my first web project, where I've cloned the website (link unavailable), which is highly animated and attractive. I've managed to make my version 90% similar to the original, while also incorporating some unique elements based on my observations. Notably, I've designed the website specifically for a mobile viewport, with a focus on phone screen dimensions. To experience it as intended, please open it on your mobile phone. Alternatively, if you're using a laptop or PC, you can simulate the mobile view by adjusting the window size to match a phone's viewport dimensions."

Feel free to ask if you need any further assistance!
